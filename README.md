# Movie Trailer Website
_by:_ Muhammad Osta

A simple one-page website, generated by a web application written in python, presenting my favorite movies in a minimalist tiles style showing the movie poster image with summery information and the ability to play the trailer from within the page.
**The project is part of the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program (FSND)](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)**

### Why this Project?
As a Full Stack Web Developers we specialize in writing applications for the web! This project is an example of such applications that is accessible via a web browser.

### How it work
The application is an Object-oriented programming (OOP) written in [python](https://www.python.org/about/) to generate a HTML web-page.

### Demo
HTML web-page demonstrating the end result of the project, [check it out!](url).

NOTE: if the website didn't render JavaScript right, the trailer might not run, [check this DEMO](url) instead.

### How to use (testing)
